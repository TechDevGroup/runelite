# Claude Development Guidelines for RuneLight Spaces

## Code Style

### File Headers
- **DO NOT** include boilerplate copyright/license comments at the top of files
- This wastes tokens and will be added during release train processes later
- Start files directly with package declaration

## Future Work
- License headers will be added during release train stuff next year
